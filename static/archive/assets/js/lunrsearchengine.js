I think I reply pretty consistently, borrowing from some of my Dad’s lessons on this topic. Dad would say, invest in your own business. At least you have some control over what happens. I think this was born from many disappointments in business, where an external event (like a currency revaluation) wiped out years of work. I would state slightly differently. “I only Invest in my own Education and my kids Education. Everything else is a Rigged Game were you cannot lose if you don’t play (paraphrasing Marla Daniels, from The Wire) And this gets me some Understanding Looks. Also, plenty of well deserved skepticism. Today, I feel inclined to explain my conclusions in a couple of paragraphs. The details are optional reading, below the summary. Axiom - I don’t believe in Perpetual Motion Machines. I ask ‘investors’ if they believe in Perpetual Motion Machines. They generally say No. I ask them then, how do you explain an Investment environment where the FAANGS and the Vanguards and Blackrocks perpetually Go Up? “Winners and losers” they say. There’s an unspoken presumption that the speaker is A Winner( see Winners are Losers) I ask. “So, you take Money, a claim on future energy, put the claim inside a system and expect more claims on energy to come back to you. ” I’m getting blank looks by now. “What?” So, you are either ‘winning’ and taking someone elses claim on the future energy, or it’s perpetual motion machine. Or a bit of both. I’m getting angry looks by now. How dare I threaten the Growth Religion? I’m happy to be a heretic on this one. Transcript of Jeremy GranthamI felt the need to transcribe the key parts of this  It’s created the biggest evil in our society and that’s inequality.  If you drive up the price of assets and it’s bound to happen if you drive rates to negative territory, Who do you make money for?  You make money for the people with assets who own the assets. The top 1 percent has 35 percent of all the assets. The top 10 percent have practically all the assets.  What’s the asset ownership of the bottom half? A rounding error. Practically none.  So, you mark up the assets and that’s your contribution to society.  What you are doing is pushing down on labour, pushing down on the bottom half, with no offset from increasing their assets, since they have none.  And you’re making the top 1% ineffably rich and the data bears that out.  Right down to the last two years when the top 1% has doubled its wealth during Covid. And the bottom 50%, I can assure you, has not doubled its wealth.  The dominance of a handful of firms has increased in most subsets.  And so profit margins have gone up and the power of corporations has gone up. And they’ve been able to use more of their power to influence governments. And they have. There is a lot of regulatory capture where people from business tend to run the agencies that regulate industries.  So, it’s been a wonderful time to make money in the Corporate system. And the share of GDP that goes to corporate profits has steadily risen and the share going to labour has steadily fallen. ” More than a couple of paragraphsSo, I’ve already taken way longer to express these thoughts than intended. In some ways, I could have deferred to Grantham. He has a lot more credibility in this area than I’ll ever have. I’m going to try and tease the energy accounting apart below. If you made it this far - thanks for your patience. This becomes more tedious and optional as I continue. Giving the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics it’s Due: For now, I’m happy to accept that energy is never create or destroyed in a closed system. Is the multiverse a closed system(s). If cosmic Inflation is the state of affairs, then the amount of Dark Energy does inflate with the volume of the Universe… Yes, there are some subtle ideas there. There might be energy at Zero Point. When people want to talk about Money, I’ll stay inside the biosphere and at People scale for now… In fact, I think you’ll find it fairly easy to get a consensus on the failure of Over Unity Energy devices to match any claim made about them. A certain skeptic will offer you “there’s no such thing as a Perpetual Motion Machine” - she’d be talking about conservation of energy. And a Talebian Fat Tony might offer you “No such thing as a free lunch” - he’d be talking about money. Money - a claim on Future EnergyI’m quoting the great Art Berman here. For all it’s complexity, you can look at our system of money as some kind of claim on future energy. Examples include:  The food, fuel and fibre that we need to satisfy the ground floors of Maslow.  The mining and refining of the earths resources.  The Embodied Energy of industrially produced goods.  The Maslovian needs of all people in there Work interactions. I would argue that the post Nixon Petro Dollar System married global military supremacy with the longest chain hydrocarbons. This happened at the end of the USAs dominance as an oil exporter (I will write on this soon - working title USA - A Marginal Energy Exporter ) It’s an Imperfect Claim: Here are some wild extremes within the $s role as unitary Claim on future energy. What should a barrel of oil cost?: The following is meant to be an example of how skewed the pricing mechanism is, when comparinghuman labour to a bunch of long chain hydrocarbons    So 1 barrel of oil has 6. 1 billion/4,184 = 1,454,459 kcals. Using a range of 100-700 kcals per human hour of work, you can think of that barrel 2078 &lt;-&gt; 14544 hours of work per barrel of oil.     You can buy that barrel of oil today for USD$91. 90     At the lowest range (2078 working hours) and the highest state-based US minimum wage, California $15/hour, that barrel should cost 2078*15 = $31,170. 00  Ben’s Potato Index:    I’ve observed the (super)market price of potatoes in many parts of the world, and compared a kilo of potatoes to the minimum wage. A kilo of potatoes is approx 1/3 of an adult calorific needs ( 750 out of ~2200)     The price of a kilo of potatoes in California today is USD$1. 80. In an 8 hour day at minimum wages, a person can acquire 8 * $15 / $1. 80 = ~66kgs of potatoes (ignoring taxes for now). That’s something like 20 days worth of carbs and fibre.     Try acquiring 20 days worth of calories and fibre for yourself, vs a full day shift in a low paid job. I think you’ll be detecting a problem with the unitary claim on future energy. I think     Cheap fossil fuels underpin industrial farming and the Potato Index.  Trillion is the new Billion   A US $100 note is a pretty popular item, all around the world. A Trillion Dollars worth of Hundreds looks like this     World GDP measured in USD is reported today as ~$84 trillion, about $10k/person.     World Debt to GDP reported by The Economist Feb 22 is 3. 5 times global GDP. We’ve borrowed three times as much as we produce per year, and this money system allows that to continue.     Given that nation states are apparently on the same Growth at All Costs Train, how can this continue ad-infinitum?  The only game in town. The disconnects about Money and Energy get far worse if you dig into the ecological impact of the mining and burning of resources. For me, it’s our addiction… our dependence on our ancient sunlight that is the key issue. Who wants to do the work of all the Cheap Energy we use every day? No Questions. No Answers. You accept it and move on. I’m quoting Jean Reno from the final frames of the film Ronin. It’s a bit of a Leap for me to jump from “this system looks entirely broken and unsustainable” through to Acceptance. This is the duality I live in these days. Nevertheless… None of this makes me keen to become an Investor in the stock market sense. "

    "title": "Instinct At Work",
    "body": "2022/02/10 - Acting on Instinct: Some years ago, I became fast friends with Helly Black. She is one of my closest friends. Maybe my best friend. We practiced karate together and talked - a lot (ask anyone who knew us both at the time). We both like to read and exchanged various books. She introduced me to Laurens van der Post and his semi-autobiographical novels about growing up in rural South Africa. While van der Post is a somewhat controversial figure, I didn’t care at the time. I followed Francois Joubert through his developing friendship with Xhabbo, Peter through his experiences on a whaling ship and into a Japanese prison camp in WWII. I didn’t care about van der Posts’ role as spiritual advisor to Prince Charles. I cared about his friendship with Carl Jung, his emphasis on forgiveness withing being a prisoner of war. This trip took me down a Campbellian rabbit hole, leading to depth psychology and eventually Gnosticism. A major category of curiosity in me that seems to stem from this time of life is - fascination about the concept(s) of Instinct within us - the Sapiens. The fundamental curiosity was this. We look at non-sapiens (ie, the Animal Kingdom) and comfortably accept the expression of Instinct in their behaviour. We act with no surprise when one of our fellow Sentient Beings somehow ‘know what to do’. I’d pondered this watching our family dog (Krypto the Red Cattle Dog) had her first litter of puppies. As a dog showing a decent amount of amusing-silly behaviour, she know exactly what to do with her puppies. Sure, this is going on around us all the time. Critters with what appear to be genetic memories somehow ‘knowing what and how to do stuff’. The experience with Krypto was personal, as she was our family dog when my children were quite young. She proved to be an amazing mother. Outstandingly, she ‘knew’ that neighbourhood kids could be trusted with her pups. Dad bread hereford cattle in large numbers on his farm. He’d speak to me about the outstanding skill of certain cows. While they all knew ‘what do do’, some were exceptional. If you’ve lived with a litter of puppies, you might have noticed (as I did, after it was pointed out to me), that you’ll be able to tell quite a bit about the puppies ‘nature’ by observation. What about Human Instinct?: Web searches can be both great and useless. If you are determined to find some credible writing, you can keep trying, keep searching, reading and following links… you might eventually find some gold. Try finding some academic papers on genetic memory. I have. Tried and tried and tried again. I found essentially Nothing (same result trying to get to the bottom of ATP function in photosynthesis ) There is plenty to ponder on this topic. If you are a parent, you will have some experience to talk about. You have these small Sapiens living with you. You are probably Making it Up as you go along. Feeling guilty for Doing it Wrong. Reading books that suggest that Right or Better way to be as a parent. How about the base of attraction that led you to a partner with whom you had a child? What’s going on Instinctually there? So, what’s going on for me about this, right now. This topic has been at rest in me for some years/decades. Like any transient thought, if it’s important, it will come back. Perception and SubjectivityAbout 5 years after my middle life fascination for human Instinct arose, I found myself studying philosophy, social psychology, human development and energy accounting (permaculture drove all this interest, founded in energy dynamics). I began subtle practices and stumbled in and out of Herd membership with society around me (contact me for a copy of Green Crash - my trip from modern to post modern world views) Now 15 years after my Permy days, things have shifted again, in that my post-post modern stripes are outnumbering my early Green perspectives. I’ve rarely spoken openly of the role of Integral philosophy in my life story. I was keen to only share it with people who show an interest, remembering my initial skepticism to Luminaries in general. Many of those who shared my enthusiasm for Integral 15 years ago have ‘moved on’. Critics have long stopped accusing Ken Wilbur of Shark Jumping, having moved on to more juicy character attacks. Integral is still foundational to my thinking. People who have grokked it are everywhere - just today, Daniel Schmachtenberger and Zubin Damania’s brilliant podcast on Saving Civilisation makes dozens of casual references to Integral. Many of us have Integrated Integral so to speak. So, what’s that done to my perception? Well, an autopoietic process of Witnessing arrived in my Daylight world that can treat my beliefs as Object (see I Dragged Myself Out of Bed) My Perceptions seem very different these days. I can (and do) pray to the God of my childhood programming and am happy to deliberately take things on Faith, so to speak… And Subjectivity? Well, I still use the term in conversations where I sense an adversarial attitude to the word Spiritual - I can say “Think of it as your ultimate Subjectivity”. This seems to tame even the most rabid atheist. So, do I walk through the world in a non-dual trance of acceptance and surrender in my Daylight hours? No, I still stumble and fall back into older modes of consciousness. I’m happy to continue the Gratitude Acceptance Surrender practice and allow it to myelinate brain proteins and enforce internal beliefs concurrently. There’s a long way to go on the GAS . I’ve experienced a Shift in perspective over the last year, feeling ready to leave many emotional patters (and even long-term and familial relationships) behind. And it’s time now to tune back into Instinct, with a set of more subtle perspectives. Instinct at workI feel that ‘my instincts’ have served me very well thus far. One might argue that instincts are best run like Gnostic beliefs. Ride a motorcycle instinctually and you with ‘Just Ride’ My grok of Instict is completely compatible with the archaic Daemon or Guardian Angel. I’m not exactly on my own here. Let me recommend James Hillman’s The Soul’s Code who’s ‘acorn theory’ could easily be referring to a genetic memory. I’m recalling the safe section of the BMW R1150 that I owen. The safety section opened with (I’m paraphrasing) “to be safe on the motorcycle you must develop your sixth sense”. I kid you not. So, I hope to explore the subtle aspects of Instinct at work in my life and espouse some ideas in various media. But, there’s another Angle to the Angel here. Instinct at WorkI’m borrowing form Steven Dubner’s play on words in his podcast titled People I (mostly) Admire. Instinct might be a non-conscious domain and layer two of Campbell quoting Kant    The best things can’t be told because they transcend thought.   The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can’t be thought about.   The third best are what we talk about.  …But. I think our Instinct’s play a significant role in our Work. I’m mixing big W and little w works here. I suspect that common perception will get that I’m talking about Instinct in the Workplace, as in, an adjunct to our interactions that occur in our ‘jobs’. You know, your interface to post-industrial revolution? How you earn Monopoly Money to interact with the computer game called Banking? That Work. My most recent ‘jobs’ came with a large package of Instinctual behaviours. I can’t write too much detail about them publicly as I have no wish to offend (or even speak ill) of people who are playing “the main game” as it’s often perceived. You know… the game where we reflect our mammalian Maximum Power Principle see Winners are Losers as a perverse desire to store up Game Tokens (records in bank accounts and on public ledgers) and justify it in the following ways:  I’m just providing for my kids (I’ve done lots of this one in the past) It’s the Only Game in town I’ve been poor. I’ve been rich. Rich wins.  All the progress of modern times is built in entrepreneurial agency. I’m just doing my part.  If I hold dollars in a bank account, I can react quickly to social and economic changes and reposition myself/my family to new conditions (I’ve been tossing this one out there recently)These are just common examples. They are far more palatable than “I’m a 2020 version of a chimpanzee - I’ll play this Game has hard as I can because all is fair in Love, War and Business. Just be grateful that I don’t rip your head off, as I would have done if I still was a chimp. ” The Exploration of Instincts at work and at WorkI’d like to continue an exploration of this. I hope to record conversations with people all over the demographic perspective and explore the more subtle side. One of the first of these conversations will be about farming and Instinct. I plan to do that in the next few weeks. "

    "title": "Anxiety Dropped",
    "body": "2021/12/09 - What is the emotion under my anxiety?: In contemplating this idea, a memory returned. A memory of a song that speaks to how I grok this topic. The circumstances around a song playing in your life can nail in some special meaning. For me, Chris Rea’s Tell Me There’s a Heaven has an explicitly weird moment in memory. I’m sitting in a restaurant in Santorini with my two younger children. Somehow, I ended up speaking about people requesting a song at their funeral. I spoke about Chris Rea’s song, that includes the following lyrics.  Oh every night a baby dies and every night a momma cries What makes those men do what they do? To make that person black and blue. We are eating our now obligatory fruit, yoghurt and honey, listening to local radio and Greek music as this discussion transpires. Then… Tell Me There’s a Heaven played on the restaurant’s sound system. Yes, just a coincidence, if that’s how your belief system works. The experience left an impression on my psyche. I can listen to the song anytime - many times. I get teary, which is unusual for me. Here’s a version of it from Chris’s ‘official’ youtube channel.  Dots connected: So what does Anxiety Dropped have to do with Heaven? Well, the fear of death of course. My Belief System now holds that… Emotions are thoughts experienced on the body. When we are in the womb, our conscious minds begin forming base emotions that become the foundation for all other emotions.  That feels good. I’ll seek more of that - Craving That feels bad. I’ll push that away - AversionSee my references to Dr Philip Stokoe in I Dragged Myself Out of Bed and Winners are Losers The above, including the references, exists in my belief system as:    All my anxiety is some expression of a fear of death. However, my rational mind realises that death is inevitable and the anxiety doesn’t serve me.     My non-rational self is more inclined to say “You need not feel fear of death - yet, your anxiety plays some role in keeping you alive, from a certain perspective”.  Lately, I’ve contemplated the need to ‘hold’ certain thoughts and emotions in a certain Frame. Whilst I’ve always known this, it’s become important lately to ‘hold’ these experiences with Gratitude. I’m not exactly on my Pat Malone here. I think you’ll find plenty of Wisdom that suggests Gratitude as a useful emotional Frame. Even somewhere as boringly mainstream and rational as Harvard University sees a role for this Giving thanks can make you happier Lately, I’ve been trying some practices that suggest I’ll receive negative emotional experiences like a Gracious householder receiving a Guest. The Guest is made Welcome initially. We make it clear that they should feel welcome. We also make it clear that this will be a short-term stay. I’ve found this useful. I hope you do too. I see a relationship here to the conclusions in Game Theory in Two Lines of Code, in particular, the last stratagem, being provokable - not letting outside influences ‘take the piss’ so to speak. A physical practice that supports Anxiety Dropped: A morning ritual that includes some seated meditation and some yoga practice has proved to be a good tonic for even low-level background anxiety. There isn’t always time for this. When there isn’t time, I’ve found a decent ‘short’ version. This involves touching my forehead on the floor/the ground, even for as little as a minute. For people that don’t mind the concept of a Goddess: I had enough Catholic brainwashing as a child to still have access to a concept of a deity. In my 40s, whilst pursuing contemplative practices, I was lucky enough to get to know Tim Mansfield and participate in some Centering Prayer training and practice. At that time, I met a bunch of people through Sydney Integral who, like me, had Christian ‘wiring’ (my term) and had been drawn to other traditions, specifically Buddhist subtle practices. Centering Prayer allowed me to sit comfortably, observe my thoughts and, with no wish to trivialise, let it all ‘go though to the keeper’. Give it to the Goddess, if you like. For me, as I’ve come to accept the contents of my Belief System to be almost entirely arbitrary, there’s no harm in asking a Goddess consciousness to be a lightning rod for my fear of death, my anxious thoughts. Can I keep that up all day long, when Work and Life through Reasons to be Anxious at me? No. To quote the cliche, it’s a practice not a perfect. And let me add one more aphorism to that. “Don’t just Do Something. Stand There!” What goes in the Frame?: Soon, I will write about my trip to Acceptance and Surrender, which again is in that category of a Practice. I’ve found that those two concepts make a great breathing mantra.  Accepting the World as it is with this In Breath…Surrendering to my mortality as this Out Breath. If I frame that in Gratitude, it’s a GAS (mnemonically anyway) Other perspectives about Anxiety Dropped: I know, I know… you’ve had one too many Alan Watts talks recommended to you. You’ve heard he was a bit of a lush or rakehell. Nevertheless. . This one is worth your time (~8 minutes) "

    "body": "2021/11/07 - Let me dukkha round to your placeI haven’t had many conversations about Permaculture in quite some time now. It’s hard to tell exactly what’s going on there. For the 15 years it’s been since I studied at the Permaforest Trust, I’ve had regular opportunities to talk about the experience. The inevitable questions begin with “What’s it about?” and “Isn’t that all about making compost?” Let me offer just one definitive quote from the late Bill Mollison:  Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system For me, it was a response to seeing the modern world differently. From Green Crash:  My daughter Carina commented on my reading list one day. The book titles were ‘The LongEmergency’, ‘Twilight in the Desert’ and ‘Collapse’. I think she could see a clear trend here thatdidn’t sound positive.  Of course, none of what I was captivated by was really News in any sense. It had just begun tomean something different to me. I looked at my air travel patterns and was horrified by the energywaste.  My ‘old self’ from page 2 had become a despicable plunderer of resources. The money I had in thebank became a source of enslavement to other people, as banks lent my savings ten times over toothers.  Any provision I’d made for my children’s future turned to dust before my eyes. Nobody around me was interested. I had to try and close my mouth about everything that wasimportant to me. Something had to change. Indeed. Things changed, for me at least. As certain parts of this trip, my attitudes would resemble the current Extinction Rebellion. In the last 24 months, my Herd membership get’s an entirely new cadence as many of my ‘permies’ have taken up new perspectives and ESG becomes the unfortunate TLA for a narrative around Sustainability. I’m listening to Eddy Vedder’s voice wolf-crying at me as a solid sleep has processed my viewing of Into the Wild last night. This morning, these thought want to find their way into the cloudy-verse. I’m thinking of Alexander Supertramp’s demise in Magic Bus and what it signifies for me on Herd membership. You only just arrived here 5 minutes ago: In the first few days at the Permaforest Trust, the founder Tim posited a thought similar to the following: “If you only just arrived here, I’d ask you to take a little time before you criticise our Systems. We’ve been developing them over decades. You may think you have a ‘better way’ to organise our meal preparation, for example. I’d ask you to keep your suggestion-box entries to yourself for a while. ” I don’t think I did a great job of putting that thought into practice, but the thoughts resonated with me then and the return to me regularly. In what’s often listed as the primary Permaculture Principle, we should Observe and Interact within our living environment. Today, the emphasis is on Observe. In fact, I might restate it as “Observe. Observe. Observe. Maybe interact. Eventually. ” Yes, I’m pushing 60 now and I would say something like that. Whilst the permaculture training came in my early 40s, the depth of patience I seem to exhibit these days looks very different. These days, I’m happy to contemplate and quote Valentine Michael Smith’s Martian wisdom, Waiting Is Green Anxiety: Having lived through at least 10 years of what I’d call Green Anxiety, I now see something similar around me in the Headlines and Streams of ‘Main’. If I had a time machine and could bring forward my 44 year old self, I’d have been right in the face of every Growth Deluded Cornicopian. I would have projected my own Anxiety through a filter of Righteous Indignation into the faces of the White Privileged world that gave birth to me. I’m trying to think a bit more like a grandparent these days. It occurred to me at some point that humans can’t see past 2 generations into the future.  I can tell a story about parenting and realising that we can’t Eat Money. There’s a version of that thought which is for grandchildren. The version about great, great, great, great grandchildren rarely gets a gig. And there’s are good reasons for that. Good, solid, Daylight Thinking reasons maybe similar to “there’s only so much you can do” or “3 generations from gutter to gutter” and various other sophistry that essentially shrugs it’s shoulders at Long Term Anything. I think some of these deluded thoughts in myself need airing out. Let me say as clearly as I can… this writing is about what’s going on for me. I don’t know what’s going on for you. I can’t read your mind. In fact, none of us can read minds. Why do I feel like I live in a time of Mind Readers? Paying the Bills: Allow me to juxtapose a couple of Bills. Don’t worry, there is a point to my choice here. Please come along for a thought experiment and some Observations. The Gates Institutional Narrative: Apologies Eric Weinstein, I couldn’t resist. For many decades, I considered Microsoft the Evil Empire of the computer industry. That’s a pretty dated thought, as Apple and Google seem to be doing a pretty good impression of Evil Empires. We used to refer to Bill Gates as ‘Bill’, in the pseudo familiar way that also made Jobs into Steve. For me, Bill ran Microsloth, which was the most annoying software company in the world to me. I would say, things have changed a good deal at Microsoft, but let me leave that for another day. Bill made a few quid and then, according to one narrative, became Foundationally involved in the amelioration of large scale health problems. God only knows how this works within minutiae of Bill’s life. I don’t know him. I’ve never met him. Like you, dear reader, he appears to be a separate-self expression of life on earth. I can’t read his mind. I don’t know if he’s a great example of philanthropy or an evil genius intent in ‘culling’ the human Herd. For now, I’ll give the Gate’s Institutional Narrative a benefit of the doubt. I’m tending to do a lot of that these days… admitting that I can’t actually know what’s going on in someone elses head. Just now and then, people pay me the same courtesy. I would say, it seems far from a universal Thing (admitting that Mind Reading is not available to most/any of us). No need for me to explore the Mintpress take in Bill Gates’ intentions. You can find that anywhere. Whether we have a cure for malaria or a devious plot to thin the ‘Herd’, our existence is primarily Impermanent. I guess Bill might not have swallowed that one yet. It’s a hard pill to swallow for members of the WEIRD world. From Dr Al Bartlett’s “solutions are the problem” through Lao-Tzu, there is a strong potential of unintended consequences that track our best efforts to be Permanent. There is a Me from 15 years ago that had the Hubris to want to tell the world What to do. At some points, I even felt that I was in charge of my own life and destiny. I can’t imagine a job interview or loan application where I’d get to say “None of us really are in charge of our own lives” and get hired or my loan approved. We get a lifetime of conditioning to suggest that we can work along the edges of Good and Bad and somehow take responsibility/credo for good outcomes, while projecting Blame onto others when things don’t work out. It’s occurred to me that a good deal of my moralist/ethical conditioning would suggest that we get a free pass from judgement if we ‘have no choice in the matter’. Did you choose to be born in the 20th or 21st century? Did you choose your parents? Did you choose to be a Skeptic (who I could be abrading with these words), or did that just Kinda Happen? The Pandemic has melted an old part of me that used to love to ‘throw mud’ at leadership. Because it could include humour. Because it divided my fellow travellers into tribes of Goodies and Baddies. Because it ‘made me feel a little bit better’ as I grabbed for some moral high-ground. For me, I’m going to try bring this paradoxical axiom more into my Daylight thinking.  If you accept nothing and want to change everything, you might find that nothing changes. If you accept everything and change nothing, you might find that everything changes. Listening to Changing Opinion is a way for me to experience a busy, daylight, WEIRD version of above axiom. Duck Bill: I never had a chance to meet Bill Mollision face to face. My friend and permie teacher Tim agreed with my guesstimate of Bill Mollision’s character - “Like Frank Burke, but with a formal eduction. ” Tim nods and effectively says “Hell Yeah”. My impression is that Bill M. was a character - all at once spiky, inspiring, funny, charismatic and Dangerous. I say Dangerous because he did several lifetimes worth of questioning the Status Quo in a way that Establishment folks would have struggled to argue with. That kind of giant personality often comes with a dark side. I won’t say too much, as it’s all hearsay anyway. And Bill has gone to the Clearing at the End of the Path, so we shan’t speak Ill of him. How would this paragraph from the Permaculture Designer’s manual wash with the 2021 Green Party (let alone the sinestro)  “The tragic reality is that very few sustainable systems are designed or applied by those who hold power, and the reason for this is obvious and simple: to let people arrange their own food, energy and shelter is to lose economic and political control over them. We should cease to look to power structures, hierarchical systems, or governments to help us, and devise ways to help ourselves. ” For me, Bill inspired us (my fellow students at the Permaforest Trust) to coin the expression we put the Cult into Permaculture Make no mistake - if Mollision and Holmgren were Good and Bad Cop, we’d have little trouble picking up the language associations. For me, I’m grateful to have stood in a forest while listening to audio of Bill teaching Permaculture One. It was a transcendant experience. Let me recommend you read David Holmgren’s The Apology: from baby boomers to the handicapped generations if you’d like a glimpse into a pre-pandemic Permie perspective (ppPp) of the state of the world. Yes, the Permaculture germ is designed to travel. It can self-seed like paspalum and breed like Tilapia. Well, it used to. I’m not quite sure now. With the edifice of Sars2 playing out, I’m not sure that we need that much help with the reversal of Globalism or the Shrinking of the Frankenstein 21st century global economy. I might just be Kinda Happening. From the Couch of Long Terms: Am I advocating that we sit back on the couch and just Let it Happen? Yes and No. Like Bill M, I’d encourage any younger person who is wanting to be adventurous to take a few risks and make a few mistakes. Life will tend to ‘sort you out’, for Better or Worse. Do Wolves and Bears have better or worse? Are we much of an improvement on chimpanzees when it comes to Culture? I have felt the sense that having kids and grandkids makes it Essential that I try my best to let them survive and thrive. My father would be interested in the Burke surname existing into the future. Would I choose to limit the resources available to my grandkids for a more sustainable world? Or did I learn how to put the Sus into Sustainability? Am I only interested in my Selfish Gene’s survival? To what end? The heat death of the universe will arrive as the entropy that Life slows down speeds up. Well, that’s in this part of the Multiverse anyway. My apologies if this writing became lecture-ish. Don’t let me over-egg my existentialism. It’s just a reflection. “And their came into Egypt a Pharaoh who did not know” That’s a quote from Martin Sheen’s Carl Fox, the father of Budd Fox in Oliver Stone’s 1987 Wall Street. It turns out, it’s not a bit of ancient wisdom. As I understand it, it’s a constructed affective aphorism. Probably most of what I might say has that same aspect. The word, my friends is Nevertheless. The world is screwed up, but Nevertheless.

    "body": "2021/10/30 - Eat Small, Eat DenseI’m fortunate to have plenty of stuff going on lately. Most if that is in the Work domain of life. It’s been seriously knocking back my podcast listening and online interactions. I struck a bunch of wonderful free stuff this week that I feel compelled to write about. Just now, I finished Sean Carrol’s interview with Thi Nguyen on Games, Art, Values, and Agency Apparently, there are transcripts on Mindscape now. I’ll find them and come back to them. Suffice to say, I’m think this pod might bring about some change in my Game Theory beliefs, particularly after the Winners are Losers post, in which the writing served a purpose that seems a bit novel. What I’m trying to express is… by writing all the way to my edge (I’m quoting Steven Grey, Adyashanti), I can sense that some of the stuck emotional struts in belief system seem a lot more mobile. The analogy coming to mind is. . [sorry, have to come back to this] "

    "body": "2021/10/24 - Was that click bait?: Why would I write such a potentially combative title for this article? Well, I think I understand what’s going on for me there. There’s a parallel to how I frame my political views. In that case, I’ve spent most of the last 25 years seeing targets on the foreheads of the politically conservative amongst us. When asked why, I’d say something along the lines of “it’s just so easy when I used to be conservative in my early 20s” There was an arc of living and learning that led to this thinking, documented in Green Crash (write to me for a copy - there are real people referred to who might not appreciate me making this public) Let me tie together:  my Belief System Growth Addiction The themes of Sapiens My take on Game Theory The Maximum Power PrincipleI hope to explain why I’m no fun to ‘play against’ and why I always let the Wookie Win Functional Programming: I’ll start with an early attempt at functional poetry or mine, which echos many contemplations of existence and mortality. 12345678910Begin If (Life = Temporary) and (NothingToFear) Then WhyAreYouCryingAllOverYourBeer()else While Not Dead  Do   (TakeGoodCareOfYourselves)&amp;&amp;(WhoTakesCareOfTheBirdsOfTheAir)  End While End ifEnd #0 From a certain perspective, our deeper minds have a habit pattern from the womb.  That feels good. I’ll seek more of that - Craving That feels bad. I’ll push that away - AversionThis is hardly an original take on the mind or existence. You’ll see such references in several spiritual traditions. This idea is my central part of my simplistic summary from Goenke Vipassana training. Though it might be foolhardy to try and write a summary, I would summarise as follows: At the root of our human formation is a survival instinct that expresses itself as our emotional base. This emotional base is drawn to ‘pleasant feelings’ and pushed away from ‘unpleasant feelings’. The Feelings are thoughts experienced on the body. By observing our Feelings on the Body we can experience the Wisdom of Impermanence - the feelings will come and go. This happens spontaneously. To live this wisdom would be to be in a near permanent flow state where we would recognise our survival instincts as the source of much suffering. The release from suffering might be acceptance of our impermanence. For me, the practices around this are difficult to bring into the Daylight World as we are conditioned to treat Death as a Taboo subject. The Modern and Post modern world views often make a laughing stock of Traditions that may allow us some freedom of the Anxiety that is growing from our Survival Instincts. Richard Dorkins: Yes, I’m going to take a pot shot at Dawkin-ism. Not because I think he is stupid or evil. However, the 4 Horsemen of the Atheist Apocalypse (now 3. or 2 Horsemen if you cancel Sam Harris(which sounds like a terrible idea to me)) had a substantial impact on my relationships. I’ve seen this arise as what I’d call a ‘look of constipation’ on the face of friends or the less familiar with whom of spoken of my experience of Belief  Dr Stokoe - “An unconscious belief is experienced as a Fact. An awful lot of fundamentalism arises frombeliefs that are taken to be facts. And facts and the sense of certainty are very comforting” Upon my path from Modern to Postmodern world views, my Catholic influences faded to an agnostic view. The kind of programming that happens to a child inside the church is powerful stuff. I’m hoping to have many conversations inspired by role of Religion in Statecraft in Dune. I look forward to Denise Villeneuve’s take on the story. For much of this time (I think of this as age 33 to late early 50s), I found the opinions of Atheists down right horrible. They’d sometimes resemble the horrible ways we behaved as children, kicking ad-hominem sand in each others faces. I’d see the Need to Win and argument as uppermost of the part of the Atheist clubbing I’d receive for Believing as I do (or Did. ) Sometime in the last 10 years, my Belief system became Object as in - I could look at it from a Witness perspective. I’ll still fall into the dictum of my Beliefs if I let my Awareness drop into Daylight Thinking. My Biases remain, despite the work of Danny Kahneman et al. I hope to let them drop away more over time. It took John Vervaeke to highlight a key part of the etymology of the word Belief - Believed - Beloved Beloved ideas take on the likeness of Gollum’s hand reaching for the One Ring - the comfort of Invisibility and endless life. My belief system contains a decent chunk of Scientism, for want of a better term. Ask my school friends about my nerdy disposition. I recall having read a Newsweek article on CFCs and the ozone layer. I spoke up about in class (year 5 or 6, as this happened in the Marist Junior School). A nearby student derided me with “YOU think you’re Scientific!” Yes, I certainly did then. If you’d told me in my 20s that my computing career and scientism mindset might be partially influenced by a repressed Anxiety, I would have given you that Constipated look. Did you just read that and wince a bit? Apologies. I am not judging your Belief systems - and that’s not because of some shiny part of my character. It’s more a case of… I don’t ‘trust’ my own belief system. To what extent that shapes my world, I cannot know about your Subjectivity. As tempting as it might be, we can’t read each other’s minds. Enter the Steel Person: I heard Eric Weinstein propose the idea of finding the best form of an opponents arguement and essaying on a perspective which is essentially the opposite of your own. There’s a much larger topic here on Difficult Conversations that needs a post of it’s own. Is Steelmaning unfamiliar to you? There’s a decent BBC program on this topic. I’ve tried a number of practices around this idea, which I’ll expand in The Sound of Changing Opinion. One of my more successful practices has been to open up to the Michael Shermer Show. In the past, I would described myself as skeptical of Skepticism. Where I hope I’m going is - seeing value in Skepticism and being able to take the Role of Other in that best form of the arguement way. I’m happy to say that I recently listened to a lengthy interview with Richard Dawkins. I did so with a relatively open mind (IMO). Towards the end of the interview, I heard some ‘open-ness’ in Dawkins that I’d never noticed before (it was essentially saying there are interior parts of Us that are un-knowable) So, did Richard chill out a bit or was it me? Well, I’m inclined to say - it was me. Taking responsibility for my Belief’s and Biases seems like a decent starting point allowing impermanence to open me up. Was it the case that I’d want to win arguements with Skeptics and Atheists in the past? Yes, I think so. And consider the kind of labelling or grouping/categorising I did in the previous sentence. Well, that Categorisation bit of myself is ingrained by life conditioning. It will not pass away easily. I recognise it in my Language Brain and yet, it can be Truly said:  As I notice how deeply I rabbit-holed these points, let me try and return to Subject. “I did once want to win at the game of life. I won some things for a while. I became bored and stopped being so motivated, even though the old habits came back at times where I let my Awareness wander. “I have no wish to Beat you at Anything. The Game is Rigged. The only way not to Lose is to Not to Play (paraphrasing Marla Daniel’s from The Wire ) I’d like to tell you about the moment that my perspective on my Belief system started to change. It’s another pop-culture reference.  That’s what happened to me. I realised that my Beliefs were largely Chosen. It’s possible that yours are too - but there is no way for me to know that. If being an Alpha Predator on this planet is all there is, I don’t want to play. Feel free to Win. I will let you Win. I won’t even try. It’s more like this for me now. In Beating You I am Beating Myself. In playing the Game with you, I’m forgetting what makes us One and what we have in common. Wanna know why I don’t care about professional sport? Isn’t it obvious yet? The rest of this essay becomes easy   Growth Fetish - the book I referred to played a major role in a consciousness shift for me. It’s very easy to summarise. Infinite Growth on a limited resource base is a fairy story with a terrible ending. (request a copy of Green Crash for details, or check this brilliant essay from Doomberg )     When Sapiens was published, I was away travelling. There are plenty of great readers amongst my friends. Ian and Suzanne gave me their copy. I read most if it in a hostel in Frieberg. Sapiens won out over the other Homo-erectus’ species because we are far better Cooperators. This cooperation is often as horrifying as War and the current Culture of Division. I barely want to play the Cooperation game any more, as so much of it is tangled up in ‘winning’. Good luck Elon and Jeff. I will happily go with Tolkien’s Gift of Men     Game Theory - nuff said already. Do you get it yet? My Subjectivity is being trained to recognise Impermanence as Wisdom. See the next paragraph for the linkage to….     The Maximum Power Principle (MPP) as both an ecological and social principle. The ecological understanding is linked with Systems science and the early days of Ecology as a discipline. A Species will maximise it’s Energy Conversion rate (power as a rate of energy conversion) or be out-competed and become extinct.  For a long time now, I’ve seen the behaviour of folks in the workplace as a anthropomorphic display of MPP. We are apes at certain scales. How often do you see Us (Sapiens) as behaving exactly like this? (this is short and might make you laugh… at Ourselves) The Patriarchy: I feel the need to speak to this topic. For me, it’s a case of social MPP. There’s plenty of Post Modernism that might agree, that much if not all of our Social Construct is some kind of power game. “Guilty” I would say on the Dock, were I on trial for being part of a Patriarchal Hierarchy. Giving up as much Power as I can and losing interest in Winning is the only response I have so far - before Impermanence takes me out of The Game. I am grateful for that. I wouldn’t choose a human nature that is so drawn to power. Lucky DayIn summary… I don’t think I’ll ever be a Gamer. Sure, I’ve been addicted to Adrenaline. I’ve felt conflicted by younger folks feeling the need for a $3000 graphics card when the have other debts. I’m embarrassed to admit that I’ve sometimes thought of Gamers as Losers. I apologise. I know that was unkind. It’s a way to some of that juice that our MPP places in us. Calling somebody a Winner or Loser is often much harsher than Discernment. I’ve found myself in a place where Mining Magnates and Politicians that speak only of Growth (as a way to get re-elected) are people who Tom Waits’ Dad described as:  Now when I was a boy My daddy sat me on his knee And he told me He told me many things And he said sone There’s a lot of things in this world —You’re gonna have no use for—- And when you get blue And you’ve lost all your dreams There’s nothin’ like a campfire And a can of beans That’s right. I’ve got No Use For Winning. Sorry, but it’ll be a boring chess game. If you’ve seen anything like what I’ve seen, you would know that Luck plays a significant role in our lives. We were born in the 20th and 21st century. Some parts of that experience might be Lucky. In fact, we are leaves in the stream more than Edmund Burke’s for good men to do nothing heros. We might have a sense of Meaning and might need to Win a few rounds before we get bored. For me, I sense that anything good or meaningful that happened to me was a kind of happy accident. And no, I’m not concerned that in certain ways Nihilism kind of resembles Impermanence. Maybe a peaceful consciousness is much more Subtractive than a post modern world’s obsession with Appearances and Power will allow. Fortunately, that condition is Impermanent. Have a Lucky Day. If you read till the very end, thank you. You might be interested in this. "

As is often the case, if you arrive at a podcast, go and have a look at the site. I was suprised by the professionalism of the site. I looked at the archive and said Wow. The transcripts and said how?. Jim was a successful computer dude, back in the day. Ran a little outfit called Network Solutions. His bio on Santa Fe Institute refers to the path he took from cashing out of Dot Bomb through to scientific research around a central topic that we often label Sustainability. So, he remains as gruff as the NYT’s label of “the Internet’s Bad Boy” and I know some folks will find it hard to get past this. This was a small-ish effort for me, as I can give him a pass for being a Country Boy with parallels to many I knew in the Genus of what we might call Tech. Game B: Jim became one of several proponents of Game B upon my collision with the term. The name is based a proposal to design a replacement for Game A - the way Life is for Humans now. Here’s a quote from the Game B Wiki  “Game B is notoriously difficult to think and talk about for the very good reason that if you were using the &gt; conceptual structures that came out of Game A to do so, you may very well be poisoning the well. ” – Jordan Hall. Two outstanding interviews: This week, I caught up with Jim and Zak Stein, who I’ve known of since I did my Lectica Decision Making Assessment(https://dts. lectica. org/_about/showcase. php?instrument_id=LDMA) some years ago. The topic is Information War and Propaganda Early on, Jim points out that we are all subject to biases… worse still, the more educated and well read we are, the more susceptible we are to confirmation bias.  And there’s a problem with doing propaganda research, actually at a high level. And I fell into the rabbit hole myself. And I mentioned this in the first paper, which is that once you start to see information thisway, and you start to realize the decades of history of sophisticated, psychologically manipulativeinformation warfare, you start to be potentially suspicious of everything. -Zak Back Soon!

    "body": "2021/10/10 - Can we simplify the Theory? I’m Game. Wanna skip to the end? The summary is, game theory studies suggest that your best strategy set for life consists of:  Being ‘nice’ to others Forgiving others Being provokable by othersSounds like grand-parent wisdom, ja? Except for the last point. Read on if you’d like to break down Game Theory and what the formal studies have shown. I can promise you some surprises. As a long time reader of Dubner and Levitt, I’ve been a listener at the Freakanomics Radio Network It’s a great resource. The newer episodes are Steve Levitt and Angela Duckworth, who have an awesome rapport and chemistry. I recommend all of the Freakanomics shows, including People I mostly Admire, No Stupid Questions and Sudhir Breaks the Internet Enter Robert Axelrod: This writing was inspired by a recent People I (mostly) Admire podcast, EP47 Why Being Nice, Forgiving, and Provokable are the Best Strategies for Life In my living study of audio learning, I’m amazed to find that salient points, such as the names of authors, will ‘stick’ even when I lose most of the content by listening while working or being otherwise distracted. I’d heard Robert Axelrod’s name many times before. Steve explains this early in the podcast.  Steve - Roughly 40 years ago, you had the idea to run a little tournament for 13 academic Game Theorists. Did you ever imagine at the time, this would launch a research agenda that get over 50,000 academic citations?  John - No, I just did it for fun The interview begins with Steve and John attempting to give a primer on Game Theory. We’ve all heard something like this before, no doubt. It’s actually not that clear of an explanation. The show’s producer, [Morgan Levy]{https://morganlevey. com/}, steps in to clarify. (I’m paraphrasing slightly here. ) The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a hypothetical scenario in Game Theory. Imagine Steve and Morgan are in custody for jointly committing a crime. The evidence the police have is weak. The are arrested at the same time and taken to separate holding cells at a police station The police explain to Morgan that their are four possible outcomes to the current situation and the Morgan’s outcome will depend on what she chooses to do and what Steve, separately, chooses to do. *Two more key pieces of information are: Steve and Morgan cannot talk to each other. Morgan has only two courses of action - Rat Out on Steve, or Stay silent. The joint scenario set looks like this:  Morgan Rat’s on Steve. Steve stays silent. In this case, Morgan is Defecting on her partnership with Steve. Morgan walks free. Steve goes to jail for 20 years.  Neither party Rat’s Out on the other. Both parties are cooperating with each other. As the evidence is weak, both are sentenced to 1 year of jail time.  Both Steve and Morgan Rat Out on each other. Both go to jail for 10 years, a lower sentence as a reward for testifying against each other.  Steve Rat’s Out on Morgan. He walks free. Morgan gets 20 years in prison. What’s the best course of action for Morgan?  John explains: Each party is better of Defecting, double crossing the other, acting on their own interest only. But of both of them do that, the both end up worse off as a result. From a Game Theory perspective, Defection is called a Dominant Strategy, meaning it’s the best strategy, no matter what the other party does.  If the other guy Cooperates (stays silent), you can exploit their cooperation by Defecting. If the other party Defects, then you’d be a sucker to Cooperate. John goes on to point out that these kinds of scenarios (which I’ve heard many times before), describe the situation where the Game is Played only Once. The emphasis on once is where the term Dilemma is earned. Steve sums up: So, this scenario describes a situation where the best thing we could do is Cooperate. But, since our private incentives get in the way, so we can’t do that. We left stuck at the only other outcome - we Both Defect, and end up with a pretty bad outcome, but not as bad as if we were made the Sucker by the Other. The Set of All Games: This podcast took me to new places in terms of game theory by distinguishing this hypothetical single-pass game from the far more common human experience of…behaviours that arise over time in circumstances that repeat, at least partially. John: The original analysis I read when I was 17 said, if you know when the game is going to end, you are better of Defecting right from the beginning. If you don’t know when the game is going to end, you can use the history of the game to update your strategy. Steve: “If you play the game over and over, you can use the future rounds to Punish the other party if the Defect on you now. You are demonstrating to the other, “I’ll cooperate with you, as long as you don’t Defect on me.  Over time, a Game-Theoretical Equilibrium can arise as both parties learn to exploit the benefits of Cooperation” John: “I call that the Shadow of the Future, the idea that the Future can effect what you’re doing now. ” The Repeated Prisoners Dilemma Tournament: John had ran a contest based on Computerised Chess Tournaments. He involved 13 academic researches who each submitted a codified or algorithmic solutions to the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma. John collected results over a number of iterations of this Tournament approach, and found the following ‘winning’ strategies’. Insights: None of the submissions included to the two most simple and obvious strategies. Always Cooperating or Always Defecting lead to the worst set of pay-offs. Reciprocity (or Tit for Tat) was far and away the most successful strategy found in the Tournament(s). The summary, from John is: “Tit for Tat - A player Cooperates on the First move. Then does what the other ‘player’ does on each subsequent move” What you are communicating is: “I’m willing to Cooperate if you are. If you’re not, I’m going to Defect. I’m just gonna Echo what you do. Hopefully you realise that you are better off Cooperating with me, then I’ll Cooperate the next time. Then we can bother do pretty well” John goes on to give explanations of tragic strategic failures - the worst of which, is Massive Retaliation or the Grim Reaper strategy. This is when a ‘player’ responds to Defection by always Defecting, getting their ‘payback’ over and over. Does this remind you of anyone you know? John finds himself stuck for words other than Nice or ‘Niceness’ to describe a key element of a successful strategy. This is to signal to the other ‘player’ of you’re preparedness to Cooperate. There is a corresponding ‘Not-Nice’ with the opposite level of success in the Tournament. The Tournament was won by Anatole Rappaport, who liaised with John after the tournament, reminding him that this thought experiment would have a poor representation in Daylight Life, due to the immense complexity of human behaviour in ‘the Wild’. The key findings from the tournament are, in order:  Be Nice. Keep Cooperating as long as the ‘other guy does’. Don’t ‘start trouble’ Be forgiving. Leaning into ‘payback’ or ‘punishment’ will cost you as a strategy.  Be provokable. If you’re a ‘sucker’ all the time, you are setting yourself up for exploitation from ‘the other guy’Why so many quoted ‘other guys’ and ‘other players’ in my writing above? Here, I’m paying credence to John’s advice through the interview. Be careful of Zero Sum thinking. There is no room for ‘opponents’ in successful Game Theoretical Strategy. In John’s experience, there are almost zero real life examples of Zero Sum situations in life - “Sports and Warfare” are about the only two. This last thought called up something pretty deep for me. I am notoriously un-interested in Games that have victors. I will write this up one day with a working title of How Winners behave like Loosers”. Larger Tournaments: Axelrod went on to involved thousands of people in tournaments to find the best strategies for the Repeated Prisoners Dilemma. The results follow the same findings, published by Stanford Daylight World examples of The Prisoners Dilemma: Here is a brief summary of ‘real world’ examples of the Reciprocity (tit for tat) strategy. Trench Warfare. : John reviewed a sociology journal referring to the Live and Let Live strategy that was reported during WWI. Artillery would shoot between the first and second trench lines. In doing so, they demonstrated accuracy, while showing the other side how not to kill or main, while keeping their Generals happy. The Selfish Gene and Altruism: John and Steve discuss Richard Dawkin’s glowing review to The Evolution of Cooperation (a book I can’t wait to read). Dawkin’s describes it as the best replacement for the Gideon Bible. But Steve asks, don’t the key findings around Cooperation run contrary to the Selfish Gene ideas? Steve - “When I interact with strangers, I, for a variety of complicated reasons around identity and wanting to feel like I’m a good person… I act like I care about them a little. I’ll be nice to them even if it’s unlikely we’ll play games over and over again. ” John - “Kinship and ethnocentrism are well studied basis for Cooperation” (BB: Mmmm - I don’t think these ideas are likely to fly in academia these day) After some back and forth on altruism, John suggests that a strong bias towards ‘nice-ness’/tendance-to-cooperate will result in “being taken advantage of”. (BB - I think we’d all have seen or experienced this behavioral dynamic) The Key Finding for me: John: “You can do really well without ever doing better than the ‘other player’. In fact, ‘tit for tat’ can not possibly do better, because it never Defects until the other ‘player’ does. This is quite counter-intuitive to most people. ” Here’s the kicker (IMO) from John “Zero sum thinking can’t make sense of this at all. But it makes sense in this context, where what works well is, if you can elicit Cooperation, not necessarily to hurt the ‘other guy’. ” For me, this helps me understand my instinct to call Winners Loosers John “It’s obvious after you Say it. You can do really well without outdoing the ‘other guy’. It’s not obvious before you say it and in fact, it even seems nuts” Wrapping Up: You can finish off the episode with some application of John’s work to the method of action in cancer cells through to the design of Cyber warfare strategies. Steve’s coda “My first Life Principle is to be Nice. My second Life Principle, is to be provokable - when someone tries to take advantage of me, I’m willing to fight. My third life principle is to be Forgiving. While I still have some work to do to reach the unlimited forgiveness embodied by Tit for Tat. All and all, these principles seem a pretty good framework to build a Life. Not bad for a strategy that only requires two lines of code” I’m looking forward to reading The Evolution of Cooperation Oh, I realise that I haven’t crystalied the Two Line of Code thing. The podcasts assumes you can visualise this or grok it in your own way. I believe it would resemble the following (which could be written on 2 lines, but I’m not feeling the relevance of that right now. ) 123456789start:Cooperate()while playing: if OtherPlayerCooperated:  Cooperate() else  Defect()end"

My morning blog post will refer to what I’ve learned about your own work. I’m embarrassed to admit, I did not know your name till today. I guess the world is an enormous place.  I wrote to you for a few reasons… It’s become important to me to say Thank You whenever it might apply. I’m playing with the idea of publishing some attempts at writing myself, purely a vocational exercise. I was encouraged by the story of publishing Mind Body Problems too. Thank you for leading more into Strange Loops and encouraging the writing I’d love to pursue. Sensemaking: For the longest time, I’ve been a bit underwhelmed by conversations about Sensemaking. I’ve been more inclined to refer to David Byrne singing “Girlfriend is Better” with the emphatic line “Stop making Sense! Stop making Sense” And yes, I think there’s a set of perspectives where sensemaking is not helpful. I’ve been However, for the Daylight world we live in, a framework might appeal and/or be useful. In this teaser (which should be a good one for Rebel Wisdom to attract customers ), David Snowden discusses the Cynefin Model - the link here should take you to 11:35, where Snowden spoke the line that made me sit up and take notice. *Nobody who understands complexity will ever make an absolute statement…because in different contexts, different things work. ” I took the discussion on my daily walk today. What’s on the radar today?I’m looking at deploying a self-hosted instance of commentio, which looks like a good candidate for Comments and Commentators in an Un-Platforming context. The commentio docs would indicate a shared instance in tracking resistance, great design, a flexible business model and a set of ethics that aligns with mine in a promising way. More later today - or not! "

    "body": "2021/09/27 - Keeping the slivers and nuggets: The internet can be horrific and wonderful in the same hour. For me, there is so much juicy content that I’ll put up with a few downsides. I’m going to try and do this every week, so I don’t forget the Wonder I experienced when panning for gold in the river of internet. A standout EssayFor me this week, A theory of my own mind was a standout. This article explores a symmetry between how we so others and how we see ourselves. An indicative quote from the article “These results suggest that a simple route for improving self-awareness is to take a third-person perspective on ourselves. In a similar way, literary novels (and soap operas) encourage us to think about the minds of others, and in turn might shed light on our own lives. ” Reading this article let to me taking a dive into material that has influential in my own beliefs/theory of mind I dragged myself out of bed Firstly, let me point at a few existing articles from this week. Top of the PodverseI just looked at my podcast history. It’s less extreme than it used to be. I’ve been described as a Podmonster by my community poddies at fishburners. org - my earphones are Always On while walking or doing autonomic tasks. There are existing articles for the two standouts:: Travis Oliphant (Numpy Scipy) on the Lex Fridman podcast and The Gray Lady Winked For meditators and those interested internal inquiry,: I’d recommend When Meditation Goes Wrong on The Daily Evolver. Jeff discusses some of the dark sides of traditional practices in a modern context. Dan Lawton, the guest, wrote this essay that led to the interview. A panel of psychologists and sociologists at the: Royal Institute  This is as mainstream as anything you’ll find. While not being explicitly unkind to fringe thinkers, I note that there was little reference to the Wild West nature of internet ‘news’ nor the loss of trust in Institutions including media, governments and commercialised Universities. Still, this content should suit those attracted to Hard Categories and narratives that encourage Exceptionalism. My reactions to this podcast is leading me into the content and references in Social Sciences concepts of Identity As we mourn the passing of: Michael K Williams , the folks at The Wire Stripped created a wonderful reflection on life, the art and the work of the actor who gave us Omar The Giving Experiment: . . is one of those stories you might never hear about without a fringe-ish podcast. In this case, it’s Chris Rynan’s most recent Tangentially Speaking Episode 494 , where you’ll hear from Christina And Owen becoming mortified as their 5 children grew emotionally disconnected from the suffering and struggle in the world. The courage expressed by these people will lift you. Check out The Giving Experiment if you don’t have time for the pod. (I would make time for this and recommend same. ) MiscellaneaWeird and Wonderful nature: This week, whilst reading about Bioluminescence, a Rabbit-Hole led me to Viral Shunt and the role it plays on role it plays the Carbon, Nitrogen and Iron cycles. Another fine thought about interdependent life that arises. Ocean bourne virus, if lined up end to end, would measure 200 light years Vincent Racaniello reference . No viral shunt, no food web. The etymology of virus borrows from the Greek ios (poison), and first referred to in Bailey’s dictionary in the 1770s This feels like a good point to end today’s write up - with a thought for today. A virus is not really alive. Without virus (plural), no food chain, no oxygen. Very funny application of a Poison word label. "

    "body": "2021/09/24 - How do we interact with our own mind?:       Adelson’s Checkershadow   The section of illusion                     Wikipedia   illusionindex 1    This is one of the most recognised visual illusion. Our visual system is adjusting for the expected light source vector. I read about this particular illusion in the brilliant Aeon magazine, which I recommend to anyone that is interested in our interiors. The article in question posits an intriguing (and, I’m sure, controversial) hypothesis. If self-awareness is ‘just’ theory of mind directed at ourselves, perhaps it is less special than we like to believe. And if we learn about ourselves in the same way as we learn about others, perhaps we can also learn to know ourselves better. Which led to me thinking about the way I describe my internal experience.  I dragged myself out of bed.  I said to myself.  “Why don’t you ask yourself about…”These language structures are pretty weird, don’t you think? One normally doesn’t admit to ‘talking to one’s self’. My experience is that basically everyone will fall in to this mode of speaking from time to time. René Descartes might not like the idea that we have no special, privileged access to our own minds. Think about the expression: what was I thinking? I might bring this up as a an attempt at self-deprecating humour. In my current self-inquiry about this kind of self-questioning, there a layers of meaning going on. I’ve often had the sense that my ‘language brain’ and the inner monologue that arises from it have very little to do with how I move through the world. I compare a flaccid attempt to deconstruct my own thoughts over some big decision, with my experience of my own trajectory over time. In my estimation of myself, I’d guess that 95% or more of my interactions with the world are non-consciously directed. Let me clarify - as with the Chomsky view, language forms some kind of layer between the non-conscious and what we think of as conscious/awake. Rather than trying to make a point here, it’s an opportunity to link to some other essays and podcasts that ‘changed my mind’ with regard to how I see my own cognition and unconscious. The labels below are my own pneumonics. Radiolab’s Left of the Blue Wall - formally titled Words. : This set of podcasts include::    Susan Shaller and the Man without Language. From her experience with teaching a man who was born in a culture with no sign-language or means of formally replacing language with those who are born deaf. In herbook, A Man without Words, she called him Ildefonso. Susan recognises the intelligence in this mans eyes and stays with him, interacts with him for some time. After some time, Ildefonso has an flash of insight. “Everything has a Name!”     Charles Fernyhough describes his experiment with Rats who apparently lack the ability to combine two pieces of information within their environment. The can learn directions (left) and colours (blue) but they**cannot combine those two pieces of information!     Elizabeth Spelke reports that study of children, who are too young to have language, exhibit this a parallel inability to link concepts.  When the children acquire language, a sentence like ‘left of the blue wall’ (a phrase that connects concepts, they gain the ability to link concepts!)     Jill Bolte Taylor’s experience of the end of brain chatter that followed her Stroke of Insight, the somewhat famous Ted talk, where Jill recounts her experience of losing part of her brain as a result of a stroke, but being able to recall the period where her language brain was offline as a blissful one     Paul Brucks (from a prior episode) reminds us that our concept of self is largely constructed as a Story.     Ann Sengas tells the story of watching ~50 hearing impaired children invent their own sign-language. Ann’s colleague Jennie Pyers observed one generation of self-taught-signers teaching younger kids the locally constructed language.     Jad, summing up “There are certain words she says that don’t just give you a name for something, somehow they give you access to a concept that would otherwise be really hard to get, or even talk about. It’s really hard to talk about thoughts without the word thoughts. Or what is time without the word time? It’s a really freaking hard concept. These words are like bridges, somehow they get you to some new mental place that otherwise you’d be cut off from. But that’s sad though these young kids have something that the people who actually invented the language don’t. ”     Susan Shaller has the opportunity to meet Ildefonso many years after their first interactions. Ildefonso now has language, and Susan has the opportunity to ask him about that time - before Ildefonso has language. Essentially, he doesn’t want to talk about this ‘dark time’ in his past. Later still, Ildefonso reports that he can no longer remember a time before he had language.  Yes, this podcast review went on way longer than intended. It was a game changer for me. I can’t recommend it highly enough. Radiolab’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Rat: So, this podcast might change your life - it certainly did change mine. This was my introduction to Joe LeDoux, author of The Emotional Brain and, much later, The Deep History of Ourselves During the episode, I learned a perspective on human memory that ‘broke the mould’ on my concept of memory. Restated as simply as I can? A memory Recall is a Write (to memory), rather than a Read. One of the many implications is: you have a cherished memory, one you’ve recalled dozens of times (eg: your first kiss with your Significant Other). . that memory has been ‘photocopied’ so often, that it is probably a less accurate memory than a recall you’ve done only once. There’s also discussion of the use of anisomycin as a part of a treatment for PTSD. I’ve since read mainstream articles (in the SMH for example) that refer to this treatment - and speak of it in a way that might be available (post trials) sometime soon. (I discussed this not long ago, with a psychiatrist that I have high regard for - he’d never heard of this topic (anisomycin and trauma treatment)). Alright - one more podcast for this thought stream. This one led to a crystalisation of understanding for me, a thought and concept that had been developing over time. Can Curiosity Change the World?: This podcast is of primo importance for me. You can download it at the ABC LNL site linked above. Thanks The larger topic is - how can we have difficult conversations, the type that degenerate into nastiness without losing our cool and becoming combative? Dr Philip Stokoe offers a wonderful suggestion for such conversations. If you can remain Curious about the person and concepts that form the difficult conversations, it’s very unlikely that either party will fall into aggressive patterns. …and that’s pretty damn wonderful - the hope that Curiosity might save our interactions around polarising ideas. I’ve been putting this idea into practice whenever the situation (and my my consciousness reminds me to Go There). I’m pleased with the results. I recommend you listen and consider. Further, Dr Stokoe is suggesting that our innate anxiety (arising from a fear of death) underlies much of the self-defensive behaviour that bubbles up when we are faced with ideas that challenge our Identity. As wonderful as this Curiosity idea is, that’s not the Killer moment of the podcast, for me anyway. Here is the Killer Statement, on the structure of belief. Dr Stokoe - referencing Ron Britton “There are two levels of belief. One is when you know you believe something and the other is when you don’t realise it’s a belief. ” Dr Stokoe - “An unconscious belief is experienced as a Fact. An awful lot of fundamentalism arises from beliefs that are taken to be facts. And facts and the sense of certainty are very comforting” More on this thread to come. : Let’s leave it there for today.       Illusion Index is well worth a look.  &#8617;    "

    "title": "Why There Are No Comments On This Site",
    "body": "2021/09/23 - No Comments!: This site is an attempt to un-platform while giving me (and anybody that wants some help) a means to createa simple and secure platform to share some thoughts and experiences. I don’t intend to do any promotion of this site. It’s my public diary and scrapbook. So, I’m doing my best to stay away from any technology that tracks interactions - like you, reading this line now. The technology (github pages and jekyll) offers a framework that supports my goals. There are many themes that support Comments on the blog framework. It sounded like a nice to have, but not essential feature to me. As I’ve learned more about the platform, I’ve realised a deeper set of complexity that comes with what might be considered simple blog comments. The world is illusory. Brahman alone is real. Brahman is the World. : Disqus. : Yeah, I’d love to discuss this. But I quickly came to realise that Disqus is not a suitable technology/platform for what I’m trying to achieve here. (It’s commonly integrated into Jekyll themes and would be ‘easy’ to deploy) I was always a bit suspect of Disqus links in sites and pages. What, you want me to sign up just to say “Hell Yeah”?. That was a decent instinct. I’ll cut to the chase. Pretty much any means that I’ve looked at that allows me to:  run a static website allows anyone/everyone/someone to comment (write)… will kind of break the mould. Sounds hard to believe. I’m pretty amazed that I never really thought about this before - just show’s how long it’s been since I’ve been actively involved in publishing anything custom online. For now, I’m going to manually curate any comments via email until I figure this one out. Not convinced. Yet. : The following appears to be containing a fair bit if truth.  If you sign up with someone/anyone’s online ‘service’, they will be capturing parts of your digital identity, even if they have nothing but good intentions! I could deploy my own comments system on a webserver somewhere. I could let anyone reply. As soon as I do that, I’ll have to manage spam and bots. This breaks the simplicity mould, meaning anything I achieve here might be of little use to others (especially people that don’t want to get into the tech details) Curating the content might be a perfectly reasonable answer for a low volume of responses. Maybe one day I’ll upset somebody by ignoring/blocking their comments. That is a tiny issue for now… and There’s gotta be a way to do this. And what is ‘this’?: Use a digital identity system that give’s visitors/commenters the ability to protect their Digital Identity and any data/content they create. In an ideal world, it might look like this:  You read some content and want to reply ‘inline’.  The experience has gotta be easy - say, no harder than replying to a tweet. (people’s preference for Ease is never more obvious than when they are Online (IMO)) We can leave a moderated ‘gate’ open for anonymous commenters.  Commentors might be prepared to use one of their digital Identities to sign and own their comments There should be trust assigned by Web of Trust Model that is easy to use. Ahem, you say. I know - this could be tricky to implement.  I have a personal ‘belief’ that people would like an anonymised digital Identity that can be part of a Web of Trust. I might be dreaming. I might be off with The Fairies. For now, I’m gonna dig into this idea. "

There is a lot more to Lex than robotics and machine learning. (eg. Eric Weinstein, Difficult Conversations, Freedom and Physics ) This particular podcast is Lex at his best. Talking techie with Travis, who’s something of a legend as I’ve come to learn. If you haven’t listened to a lot of long-form podcast, this is a great example. Today, I finished my walk along with another brilliant long-form podcast, ready to take on some training for a couple of hours. Travis is a character, in my view.

Well, the editorial policy might have a relationship with family dynamics. For much of the world, the letters NYT recall many of the emotions that brand creators dream of. The ‘newspaper of record’. My (former) admiration for the brand and the publication has been taking a few knocks over the last year or so. Bari Weiss’ story is a case in point, IMO. Today, as the podcast began, I was working away and listening in the background. Then, I was pulled to attention pulled into the podcast. I heard about the idea that NYT falsely reported that Poland invaded Germany in the run-up to WWII. I rewound the podcast and took it with me on my Covid Constitutional. What I learned about the NYT over the ~100 minutes had my eyebrows doing lots of push-ups. If you know me at all, you’d know that I have a complex relationship with Skeptics generally. I saw some unexpected value in skepticism today - preparedness to question Grand Narratives. But more than this. To Poke the Bear. Rindsberg describes the reasons for self-publishing The Gray Lady. I would imagine that this book and the podcast I’m referring to will be ‘divisive’ in the extreme. This would be the kind of post that would get me flagged on facebook. com (references to FB in the podcast). The power of NYT is at the scale of Big Tech. But it’s older and more entrenched.

I’ve been blessed with many wonderful interactions, especially lately. I spoke about the idea that human’s minds might be immortalised in computer systems, many stories coming to mind. Living in lockdown, we are experiencing parts of this idea. I probably have a bigger dose than most; I’m online for much of the day. My face-to-face interactions have become very special - I’m fortunate to have a bubble partner…she and I have been able to hang out every couple of weeks. They are occasions to look forward to and reflect on. … and maybe stop me from enjoying lockdown too much. The phone call with my friend and mentor was patchy - poor reception, probably at his end, which is rural. The hard edge on voices and the ‘coldness’ of digital music fit the Story.

I’ve got almost zero ideas on the appropriate image for the concept of Un-Platforming. I didn’t invent this term. I see a few other people using Un-Platforming as a term. In my view, it’s an idea who’s time has arrived. Many of us are noting a feeling of getting ‘stuck’ in Big Tech mind trap. We can interact via youtube, joust on twitter and keep in touch with cousins on facebook. For well over a decade, we’ve known that We Are the Product when the service is ‘free’. There were projects that gave me some hope - diaspora. org being the most hopeful and tragic story. A public part of the internet to interact. The chance of spending time without seeing advertisements. Some choice about how our data is used. The Winners Took All. Yes, you can find communities on Mastadon. I’ve tried. I find myself back on more mainstream services. It’s all a bit hectic and unchanging in direction… more gravity pulling in more people to a smaller number of Giant … things, that have been labelled Platforms. We are stuck in a status quo of Ease… finding some smaller, less mercantile spaces online requires some effort. And some coinage sometimes. I haven’t quite given up. Quite to the contrary, I’m having another go at pulling away from this Big Tech Black Hole effect. Let me tell you how Frustration has played a part in this current initiative. As people diverged over their choices of media platforms (social and journalistic) and messenger applications, there’s been a frustrating aspect that I’d like to address. People split into brand-loyal groups that gain the ironic label of Tribes. Think iPhone vs Android, WhatsApp vs FB Messenger, Google Workspace vs Microsoft O365. More recently this is Zoom vs MS Teams and Paid Journalism vs Free Opinions. For the longest time, I’d want to include as many friends as possible in conversations. If you’ve read my facebook feed, it’s been a reasonable source of developments in science and engineering, in a garden of Dad Jokes. There are a substantial number of my friends that ‘don’t do facebook’. Fair enough. Other’s ‘don’t do social media’. Also fair enough. Other’s still who ‘don’t read their email’. Ok. Many that would kind-of like-to have some secure conversations, but never got in the habit of Signal (when they got dirty with WhatsApp over a change in terms of service) The quintessential example is “I HATE facebook. Catch me on Instagram (which belongs to Facebook)”. So, when there’s been conversations to route through so many options, I’ve often taken the painstaking approach of  write up the post, including the links and access to content.  post on facebook post on many Slack channels handwrite some email and paste in the post content in the email. Too hard? You betcha. I’ve known how to simplify this process for a while. An Old School Blog would do the job. Interacting with the world (when Speaking/Writing) might follow a process like this:  Read some news, ponder the world or watch a film. Decide to Write about it/share some news.  Knock out the blog post.  If there are some individuals who are very likely to be interested in the post, fire off an email or Slack message.  But, the above is probably rarely true and not necessary most of the time. What I’ve wanted from my post is my own record of the film review or new development in physics. example Stanford scientists develop water splitter that runs on ordinary AAA battery - this was on my Facebook feed from August 25 2014. I forget the details but remember where I saved a pointer to the article…. that’s what facebook as been to me for the longest time. My ‘blog’. What’s a reasonable way to do this?: Let me start by listing what I don’t want to characterise my alt-platform/un-platform…  I don’t want to be told what I can and can’t write about… I don’t want to have to painstakingly deal with each Tribes preferences about how the interact.  I don’t want to get ‘stuck’ on a Platform, big tech or otherwise.  I don’t want to recommend a Way Out of platforms that’s costly in $$ terms. But, it can’t be Free. I am getting sick of being the product. Ok, sorry for the long rant. We are getting to the main points.  As the author, I remain the owner of my data. If the way I serve it up goes away or turns to the Dark Side, no big deal - I’ll just move on.  Ideally, I’m being web-served by a system that is reliable and well curated from a systems security perspective.  Keeping the site up should cost about $20/year. Services like Squarespace are potentially two orders of magnitude more.  Where I Publish stuff, I don’t want to:     Run any services that need maintenance or monitoring.    Expose any potential readers to any form of tracking or malware.     In short, it’s a read only, static website.  I’ll use some kind of framework that is popular and unlikely to die.  I’ll treat my writing like code and use git as a code management system.  I’ll find a way for people to Comment that doesn’t compromise me or the Commenter (I haven’t cracked this yet. )If you are reading this, you are on my Un-Platform.
